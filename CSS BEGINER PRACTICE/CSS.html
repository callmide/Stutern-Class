            My name's <span class="Bold">Abdulsalam Ayomide Mariam</span>, my love for technology steamed from my love for <span class="Italics">design</span> and the comfort life, I love to design the most comfortable easy to use products.

        <!-- <h1 style="font-size: 18px;">Second section</h1> -->
        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(230, 84, 84);">Starting this class has been game changer for me, it has helped me practice <span class="Italics">dedication</span> and wanting to show up everyday. I learnt new things I didn't think I was going to be interested in, <span class="Bold">HTML</span> and <span class="Bold">CSS</span> has made me view designing differently, I view margin and borders more boldly now and containers and alignment feel different.</p>

            <p>The difference between <span class="Bold"> Paddings, Margins</span>, and <span class="Bold">Borders</span>.</p>
            <li><span class="Italics">Padding</span> is the space between the content of the box and the border of the box i.e the air surrounding the space btween a box and a christmas gift in it.</li>
            <li>The <span class="Italics">Border</span> is the solid line or perimeter of the box. It can be designed as dotted, groove, etc, the default one for all is invisible</li>
            <li> <span class="Italics">Margin</span>  is the space outside the whole box i.e after the border. It can also be styled differently</li>
        </ul>
